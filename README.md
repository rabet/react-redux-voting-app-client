# Client App
Upgraded version of Client App from awesome ['Full-Stack React-Redux-Immutable Tutorial'](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html) by Tero Parviainen. 

## Changes
* ported to React v0.14 (classes etc.)
* ported to [redux-router *v1.0.0-beta3*](https://github.com/rackt/redux-router)
* removed 'react-hot-loader' in favor of [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)
* added [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools). 

I also plan to add inline-styles with the great Pete Hunt's jsxstyle instead of requiring external ".css" files.
